# Babuntoo Academy

A comprehensive Flutter educational application designed to teach computer science fundamentals, programming languages, hardware components, software knowledge, and inspiring stories of scientists.

## 🚀 Quick Start - Setup & Run on Your Local Device

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Flutter SDK** (3.0 or higher)
   - Download from: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   - Verify installation: `flutter --version`

2. **Dart** (included with Flutter)
   - Verify: `dart --version`

3. **Git**
   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/

4. **IDE/Editor** (choose one)
   - Android Studio (recommended)
   - VS Code with Flutter extension
   - IntelliJ IDEA

5. **Android/iOS Setup**
   - For Android: Android Studio with SDK 21+
   - For iOS: Xcode 12+ (Mac only)



### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tahsan0619/babuntoo-academy.git
cd babuntoo_academy
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This command downloads all required packages listed in `pubspec.yaml`.

### Step 3: Configure API Keys (Optional)

If you want to use the Code Playground feature:

1. Open `lib/code_playground_screen.dart`
2. Find line 9:
   ```dart
   const _groqKeyStorageKey = 'YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE';
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Groq API key
4. Or the app will prompt you to enter it on first launch

### Step 4: Run the App

#### On Android Device/Emulator:
```bash
flutter run
```

#### On iOS Device/Simulator (Mac only):
```bash
flutter run -d ios
```

#### On Web Browser:
